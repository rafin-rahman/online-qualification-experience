# Online Qualification LTD - Project Overview

## Project Description

Online Qualification LTD is an e-learning platform designed to offer a diverse range of educational courses globally. The platform includes short courses for skill enhancement, certified courses, and both Undergraduate and Postgraduate programs. It is tailored to serve both businesses (B2B) and individual students (B2C), providing customized solutions to meet various learning needs.

## My Role

As a Senior Software Engineer at Online Qualification LTD, the role involves leading the project with responsibilities split into two major components:

1. **B2B Platform Development**:
  
  - **Role**: Act as the solo developer responsible for building the B2B side of the platform.
    
  - **Objective**: Implement a B2B platform that enables businesses to sign up and purchase courses for their employees.
    
  - **Features**: Businesses can manage course enrollments, track employee progress, and access certification records.
    
  - **Tech Stack**:
    
    - **Frontend**: NextJS with TypeScript
    - **Backend**: NodeJS (Express)
    - **Database**: PostgreSQL
    - **Infrastructure**: Vercel for deployment, Vercel Blob for document storage, Supabase for database management
2. **B2C Platform Vendor Selection and Management**:
  
  - **Role**: Manage the project implementation both as product and technical level
  - **Objective**: Identify and collaborate with a software vendor to build the B2C component of the platform.
  - **Features**: Direct student interactions including course sign-up, payment processing, and certification issuance.
  - **Integration**: The B2C platform will interface with the B2B platform via APIs to ensure seamless data flow and user experience.

## Development Process

### Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: NextJS with TypeScript for a robust, scalable, and maintainable UI.
- **Backend**: NodeJS with Express for a flexible and efficient server-side application.
- **Database**: PostgreSQL for reliable and scalable data management.
- **Cloud Infrastructure**:
  - **Vercel**: For deployment and hosting of applications.
  - **Vercel Blob**: For storing documents and other file assets.
  - **Supabase**: For database services and management.

### Environment Setup

1. **Local Development**:
  
  - Set up the local development environment using Docker to ensure consistency across development setups.
  - Use `.env` files to manage environment-specific variables and configurations.
2. **Staging**:
  
  - Deploy to a staging environment to test new features and changes in a pre-production setting.
  - Use staging-specific configurations and databases to simulate production conditions.
3. **Production**:
  
  - Finalize deployment to the production environment using Vercel.
  - Ensure robust monitoring and logging to track application performance and issues.

### Leadership and Collaboration

In my role, I will:

- **Lead the Project**: Direct the development of the B2B platform while working closely with the selected software vendor for the B2C component.
- **Software Vendor Coordination**: Actively collaborate with the vendor, providing guidance and ensuring alignment with project goals and standards.
- **Involvement in Development Lifecycle**: Be deeply engaged throughout the software development lifecycle, including:
  - **Code Repository Access**: Have access to the vendorâ€™s code repository to monitor progress and ensure adherence to best practices.
  - **Code Review**: Review code quality and maintain high standards of programming practices.
  - **Quality Assurance**: Oversee the implementation of effective testing and quality assurance processes.

### Team Management

Once the platform is complete, I will:

- **Build a Development Team**: Recruit and onboard a team of developers to support ongoing development and maintenance.
- **Training**: Provide training and mentorship to the new team members to ensure they are well-versed with the tech stack and project requirements.
- **Project Sign-off**: Oversee the final review and sign-off of the project to ensure all deliverables meet the specified requirements and quality standards.

## Conclusion

This project aims to create a comprehensive and user-friendly platform for both businesses and individual learners. By leading the development of the B2B platform and managing the B2C vendor selection and collaboration, I am contributing to a significant advancement in online education and corporate training.
